================

.NET wrapper classes around the miiCard API and OAuth authorisation process.

##What is miiCard

miiCard lets anybody prove their identity to the same level of traceability as using a passport, driver's licence or photo ID. We then allow external web applications to ask miiCard users to share a portion of their identity information with the application through a web-accessible API.

##What is the library for?
miiCard's API is an OAuth-protected web service supporting SOAP, POX and JSON - [documentation](http://www.miicard.com/developers) is available. The library wraps the SOAP endpoint of the API, making it easier to make the required OAuth signed requests. It also provides a very simple code interface for initiating an OAuth exchange with miiCard to obtain OAuth access token and secret information for a miiCard member.

You can obtain a consumer key and secret from miiCard by contacting us on our support form, including the details listed on the developer site.

##Usage

### API wrapper

To use the API wrapper, you'll need:

* Consumer key and secret (available by request from miiCard)
* An access token and secret for a given miiCard member, obtained by pushing the member through the OAuth workflow

The API wrapper wraps the methods of the miiCard API and makes them easily accessible to managed code. To start, new one up:

    var apiWrapper =
        new miiCard.Consumers.Service.v1.MiiCardOAuthClaimsService
        (
            MIICARD_CONSUMER_KEY, MIICARD_CONSUMER_SECRET,
            accessToken, accessTokenSecret
        );

Then call methods on the wrapper corresponding to the miiCard Claims API methods - they are named identically. For example, to obtain the set of data a miiCard member elected to share with your application:

    var response = apiWrapper.GetClaims();
    var userProfile = response.Data;

### Supported frameworks

The library also contains a drop-in server control for ASP.NET applications, and classes to aid in performing an OAuth authorisation workflow in MVC applications. See the [.NET library documentation](http://www.miicard.com/developers/libraries-components/net-library) on the miiCard.com website for more details.

##Test harness

The [/test folder](api-wrappers-dotnet/tree/master/test) contains a quick test harness to allow some interactive testing of the library. It may serve as a guide for how to quickly get up and running with the library but hasn't been extensively checked for correctness or security and should be considered a local diagnostic tool only. It is an MVC4 web application and takes dependencies on several DotNetOpenAuth libraries managed by NuGet.

##Documentation

Documentation is available at http://www.miicard.com/developers/libraries-components/net-library, and is intended to supplement the API documentation available on the [miiCard Developers site](http://www.miicard.com/developers).

##Dependencies

The library takes a dependency on [DotNetOpenAuth](http://www.dotnetopenauth.net), an excellent OAuth library by Andrew Arnott. It's available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotNetOpenAuth) or [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/DotNetOpenAuth/DotNetOpenAuth).
